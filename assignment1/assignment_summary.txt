PART 1
1)use loops to create a specific 4x4 matrix

2)write a function that calculates the determinant of a 3x3 matrix

3)using (2) calculate the determinant of (1)

4) print the matrix and its determinant to the screen

PART 2
1)write a program that calculates geometric series Sn

2)create a loop that runs from 1 to 3 (this is verbatim from assignment, not 100% sure what it means)

3)Design a switch/case construct that selects for three different values of n,a,r (again not sure)

4)compare results

5)Values are: n = 10000,a = 2.0,r = 0.01 and n = 500,a = 0.01,r = 1.1 and n = 100,a =0.0001,r = 2.0.
  (seems like the question might be written in the wrong order or something??)

6)comment on results
